# -
the parables of tomorrow-
dear tomorrow,
i do so wonder,
how was your day?
was it full of laughters,
or maybe a storm came and never left, 
or  it snowed and hardened your heart?
nevertheless, 
did you sow the fields for the cat,
or perhaps 
it came home on its own?
did you wake up?
or slept at night and never woke up?
there are so many questions for you, dear tomorrow,
but after all of them,
the fact that i am writing a letter to you,
is because i know,
i trust myself for tomorrow
to be another day.
love, 
today.
